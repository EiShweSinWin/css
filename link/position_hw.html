Like the flower itself,<br> the history of the rose is very colorful.<br> Roses have been naturally growing for over 35 million years! However, they were not known to be cultivated until about 5,000 years ago. Their usage began not just as a decorative touch to one’s home, but they were also used for medicinal purposes and to make perfumes, and their petals were even used as confetti for festive occasions. Getting your roses into water quickly is the first step in caring for them. Fill a vase three-fourths full of fresh, cool tap water. The roses will absorb the water, soaking up the nutrients that will travel up to the bloom and create a lively flower. Check the water level in your rose’s vase every day and add more water as needed. Shop these classic flowers for Valentine's Day!
You know summer is here when big, showy hydrangea bushes begin gracing gardens across the country. <br>This perennial, a native of East Asia and the Americas, comprises more than 75 species and 600 cultivated varieties, of which mophead, lacecap, oakleaf, and peegee are the most common. Some hydrangea flowers can turn a pretty pink or blue depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the soil, while others will remain white. Mopheads, lacecaps, and oakleafs bloom on the previous year's wood and can be pruned in the summer after flowering; peegees bloom on this year's wood and can be pruned in the late winter, before the new spring growth.
